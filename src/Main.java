/*
- neuron and synapse class

- can use either layer class for each synpase/neuron layer (will have to have subclasses for input and 
output layer) or an overall neural network class. Could also connect neurons and synapses individually with
each neuron/synpase containing adjacent neuron/synpase as a attr.

- implement forward and backward propagation (research math calculations and activation functions)

- decide on data set to train/test and build relevent layers

- test/train

-? implement graphing library to debug training/testing
